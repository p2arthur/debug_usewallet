Since we first launched back in May 2021, Dartroom has expanded its network, secured major investments and grown a diverse, digital community of creators and collectors. Right from the start we’ve been committed to decentralisation and are determined to build a platform that puts artists first.

Now, two years on, we’re excited to announce a platform relaunch and rebrand. This follows the addition of several new features that increase the security of our entire ecosystem, bringing us closer in line with the brand we set out to be.

## Platform Enhancements

Our new platform has been redesigned with better usability in mind, for creators and collectors alike. All improvements have decentralisation and safety at their core, to give our community more confidence to explore a wealth of NFT digital art on Dartroom.

### Bespoke file storage

One new feature we’re really excited about is our in-house InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage solution, Fileroom. This essentially gives Dartroom users more control over their NFTs, by allowing them to store files safely and securely without relying on just one company or server. Instead, users get direct access through Dartroom, cutting out the need for a middleman, whilst allowing for bigger file sizes and improving overall performance.

### Secure network access

Another major step for us towards deep decentralisation is the introduction of Noderoom. This important aspect of our platform update lets us control our own access to the Algorand network. By running our own nodes that connect directly to the Algorand network, we remove the need for third-parties and increase the overall security for everyone. Under Noderoom, we will also develop open-source tools and programs to build a fully decentralised base for our on-chain activity.

## The Dartroom Journey

Our feature updates align more closely with the philosophy that Dartroom was founded on. We’re proud of our Dartroom story so far, and our new platform better outlines our journey and the values that underpin every decision we make as we continue to expand.

### Our values

As well as striving for deep decentralisation across all touchpoints of NFT creation and collection, we’ve also strengthened our verification process, to ensure art on Dartroom is always properly certified. This, along with our commitment to being a circular, artist-first community, is what shapes us as brand and informs our future.

### New aesthetic

In the spirit of our artist-first approach, we worked with one of our very own, [Kanda](https://v2.dartroom.xyz/artists/berkanda), on the graphic design of our new branding. The colour scheme, logo and aesthetic are visual cues to the vibrant, virtual space we’ve developed and helps put creativity at the centre of our identity.

It’s exciting to see the Dartroom platform evolve with the needs of our community. We feel we’ve set the standard for future features and updates, and are staying true to our mission of building a space to create, collect and connect in decentralised sustainable art.
