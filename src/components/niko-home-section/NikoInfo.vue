          The NIKOs token is the internal currency of the rxelms universe,
          acting as the foundation for transactions and interactions within the
          metaverse. It is used in marketplace transactions and voting, and it
          is also central to participation rewards and encouraging creativity
          within the community. The distribution strategy of NIKO, managed by
          Dartroom, emphasizes non-commercialization of the token, prioritizing
          its use to strengthen the rxelms ecosystem.
